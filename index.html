        <h1 class="my_1">Sweet Laurochka!</h1>
        <p class="text_1">My lovely gorgeous Laura, I wanna congratulate you with this wonderful event, the international women's day.</p>
        <p class="text">I wish you to stay such a beautiful girl, but not only as a girl, but also as a person. Im so grateful for everything you've done for me. For your support and help in hard times, for your happy smile which always makes me happy as well. For your lovely character, you always can understand me whatever there is. You are the person who thinks twice ( or usually even more) before doing something, but you aren't that kind of person, who just only think and doesn't act. You want to be 100% ( or even more) sure in your plans and actions and that's really cool.</p>
        <p class="text_2">All in all, I just wanna say thank you so much, Malysh, for who you are, for your wonderful personality, amazing beauty, and witty mind. <b>Love you so much!</b> <3<3<3</p>
        <br />
       <p class="second_text text_2" >P.S. here are some photos of you :)</p>
